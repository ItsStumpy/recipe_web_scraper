### Equipment

* 1 large bowl or deep casserole dish

### Ingredients

#### Æblekage filling

* 3 cups apple sauce
* 3 cups bread crumbs
* 1/4 cup granulated sugar
* 2 tbs butter
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
* 1/2 tsp ground clove
#### Whipped cream

* 1 cup heavy cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 tbs granulated sugar

### Instructions

#### Breadcrumb Prep

* In a cast iron pan over medium heat, toast the breadcrumbs, sugar, and spices in the butter until golden brown, then let cool.
#### Trifle Assembly

* In your chosen vessel layer in alternating layers of breadcrumbs and apple sauce until you run out of both.
* Refrigerate until ready to serve.
#### Whipped Cream

* When ready to serve, take your heavy cream and add in the vanilla extract and a little sugar, then whip until you have whipped cream. If you have butter, I'm sorry but you can't undo that.
* Either top the trifle with your whipped cream, or just dollop on top while serving.
